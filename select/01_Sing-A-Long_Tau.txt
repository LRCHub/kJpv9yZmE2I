It's Tau eggs with the grits girl
Hahaha
Yea

Hey my name is Ty and i'm not that kinda guy
To be confrontational but if you want to you can try
You get punched up in your eye
To begin
If i'm being honest i don't know who my real friends is
If i'm being honest Rick and Morty i like to beng
And to keep it real me and my sister look like twins
And i just really met her
I been stressing my mom out i'm trying not to sweat her
If i could do anything write my younger self a letter like
You're the greatest
You really been the man
You can do anything
Long as you drop them toxic friends
And stay positive you gone be poppin
You just keep it pushing
They gone watch you
While you baking
Just don't drop a cookie
Got the sauce
They see the godliness in ya walk
Just keep the cross
And you gone pop like Diana Ross
Boy you a boss
Just tap into ya power
Got the nectar just like flowers
You get better by the hour
Sing this song like

I'm the greatest
I'm on Gods A-list
All these negative ppl round me why you acting heinous
You shouldn't have to force it homie you shouldn't be straining
Working my inner love but it feel like i'm just training
(Sing along sing along)
I'm the greatest i'm the best
I'm amazing i'm not the rest
You couldn't be me if you cloned
And if you feel amazing sing along
Sing along

I be sad sometimes
I'm mad sometimes
People get on my nerves
Make me wan crash sometimes
It be bad sometimes
Trash sometimes
You can throw all the shade
But you can't mask the shine

Cause i'm lit
Hope you feeling happy cause i'm is
If it ain't benefiting then i split
I don't play the games or no tricks
Ain't got the time don't have a watch on my wrist

Hold up wait yes i do this everyday
You can't block this energy
Yo tetris game look kinda cray
Keep this in yo memory
Look you don't even need a bae
Be the best you you can be
And i promise you gone be straight

You know i love me enough to cut you off (snip snip)
And they can tell i got the sauce from how i walk (drip drip)
I won't hang around you if i think you wrong (oh no)
And if you feel amazing sing along sing along

I'm the greatest
I'm on Gods A-list
All these negative ppl round me why you acting heinous
You shouldn't have to force it homie you shouldn't be straining
Working my inner love but it feel like i'm just training
(Sing along sing along)
I'm the greatest i'm the best
I'm amazing i'm not the rest
You couldn't be me if you cloned
And if you feel amazing sing along
Sing along

I'm the greatest
I'm on Gods A-list
All these negative ppl round me why you acting heinous
You shouldn't have to force it homie you shouldn't be straining
Work my inner love but it feel like i'm just training
(Sing along sing along)
I'm the greatest i'm the best
I'm amazing i'm not the rest
You couldn't be me if you cloned
And if you feel amazing sing along
Sing along
